## Powerups
The game includes powerups, denoted by symbols.

`POWERUPS = ['G', 'S', 'K', 'T', 'F', 'B']`

1. 'G' Grows the size of the bar - has an upper limit
2. 'S' Shrinks the size of the bar - has an lower limit
3. 'K' sticKy ball. Makes the ball love the paddle. One time only!
4. 'T' Through ball. Shreds through ALL bricks; even unbreakable ones!
5. 'F' Fast ball. So fast it becomes John Cena.
6. 'B' Big balls. 'Splits' each ball into two. 

## Cheat Codes
Heavily inspired by GTA, in both looks and other major aspects, my game features cheat codes as well. I am a lazy programmer. What could they be?
